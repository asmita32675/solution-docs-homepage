This repository contains the source code for https://docs.rackspace.com/docs/ website.

The content is written in link:https://github.com/yuin/goldmark/[Goldmark-style Markdown] and
link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc]. It is generated by
link:https://gohugo.io/[Hugo].

== Requirements

=== Install the dependencies directly

==== Install Hugo directly

To build the documentation locally, install link://https://gohugo.io/[Hugo] and have the `hugo`
command available in your PATH. Use **Hugo version 0.73** or newer. You can install `hugo` by using
your system's package manager. For example, on OSX, type the following command to install `hugo`
with Homebrew:

```sh
brew install hugo
```

For more information about how to install Hugo, see
link:https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/[Hugo installation documentation].

==== Install Asciidoctor directly

The documentation build also requires the Asciidoctor Ruby package to process `.adoc` files. To
avoid having to install Ruby packages as the root user (with sudo), add the following lines to the
`.bashrc` (for Bash Shell) or `.zshenv` (for Z Shell) in your home directory:

```sh
export GEM_HOME=$HOME/.gem
if [ -d $GEM_HOME ]; then \
    export PATH=$GEM_HOME:$PATH; fi
```

Create the `~/.gem` directory:

```sh
mkdir -p $HOME/.gem
```

Log in and log out (or `source` the environment file you changed previously) to pick up the changes.

Now, install Asciidoctor and any additional dependencies:

`make install`


====  Start a local web server

To preview documents in a web browser such as Chrome, start the Hugo server on your device.

Hugo has a live `serve` command that runs a small, lightweight web server on your computer so you can
test your site locally without needing to upload it anywhere.  As you make changes to files in your project,
it rebuilds your project and reloads the browser for you.

To start the Hugo server, perform the following steps:

1. Change directory to the root directory of your document repository.
2. Run the following command:

`netlify dev`

The Hugo server displays some messages while it starts up.  The last line should be:

`Web Server is available at http://localhost:1313/ (bind address 127.0.0.1)
Press Ctrl+C to stop`

You should now be able to access the Support How-To using the generated link. You cannot use the Support How-To dropdown
to navigate to your new article. To access your article:

1. Select the link generated by Hugo.
2. In the search bar type '/support/how-to/' after the existing local address.
3. Copy and paste the information from the slug section of your metadata after the '/support/how-to/' text.

This running instance supports live reload. Changes you make to files are automatically updated in
your running instance.

Some files may not be supported for live reload. If you are not automatically seeing your changes,
you may need to restart the server. You can restart the server by pressing 'ctrl-c' and running
`netlify dev` again.
